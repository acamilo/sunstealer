## SunStealer

Sunstealer is a 15 watt single color (rs485) networked LED strip built using a LT34781 driver and a PIC32MX110F016B.
These strips are intended to be used to build larger LED pannels with each strip covering a specific wavelength.

There will be 5 variants of the strip each populated with LEDs targeting te following wavelengths (439,469,642,667,740) initially with the following ratios (1,1,2,2,1) This should make 1 105w LED light for hydro/aquaponics.
